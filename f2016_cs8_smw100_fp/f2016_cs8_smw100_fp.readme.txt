This final project was an extension of assignment 3 using classes. The Runner class is created
along with methods described in the assignment. Syntax for required programs and class statements
were created by Max Novelli some naming conventions were changed.

I quickly ran into the same problem from assignment 3. Even with pasting in the instructor's code and
hard coding the masterfile I was unable to get the program to run properly. The opfile program was employed
from assignment 3 (with changes made due to instructor comments).
