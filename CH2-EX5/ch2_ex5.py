# Description: Program to display distance over time, for various time inputs

print 'The car is traveling at 90 km/h'

time = 6
distance = speed * time
print 'after 6 hours the car has travelled: ', distance
time = 10
distance = speed * time
print 'after 10 hours the car has travelled: ', distance  # changing time = 10
time = 15
distance = speed * time
print 'after 15 hours the car has travelled: ', distance  # changing time = 15
time = 2.25
distance = speed * time
print 'after 2 hours and 25 minutes the car has travelled:', distance  # changing time = 2.25
